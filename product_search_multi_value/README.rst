Configuration
=============

By default, the multi value search looks on default_code and barcode properties.
If you need to extend to other property, you just need to adapt the related system parameter: 'product_search_multi_value.search_field'.

Usage
=====

Go on the product search view and search on a list of default_code separated by a space.
The search must be based on "Multiple search" field.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The searched fields should not be related non stored ones where the target
  model has an 'active' field as it can leads to not found records.
