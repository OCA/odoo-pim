A basic module for Product Information Management.

The module itself doesn't do anything. It only creates a new application menu "PIM" gathering native views about Products :

- Products and Products Variants views
- Attributes
- Categories
- Units of measure

It also creates a new user group category with 3 access rights levels :

- PIM Reader
- PIM User
- PIM Manager

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

Define your user **PIM access rights** in the Application Accesses as a Manager, User or Reader and the application menu "PIM" will appear.
