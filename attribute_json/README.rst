This module allows the user to create attributes to any model. These attributes are stored in a jsonb column in the database.

When a new field of nature json_postgresql is created, we create a field with an inverse, compute, search method that is going to be used to access the jsonb field. The module also add a new variation of the select type, named selection using the selection field of odoo.

Limitations:

Currently, the module does not support the creation of Many2One, One2Many, Many2Many fields in Odoo. This is because the jsonb type in postgresql does not support the creation of foreign keys.

Usage
